# Pre-MVP Technology Disclaimer

Sapphire CMS is a pre-MVP project under active development. It is not yet stable and suitable for production. It may

# What is a Progressive CMS?

A **Progressive CMS** is a content management system that starts with a tiny core and grows with your project.
It’s modular by design, serverless-ready, and built for a multi-platform world.

## Why Sapphire?

We believe the future of the web is serverless and edge-first - and we're building the CMS designed to power that future.

Sapphire is designed to be:

- **Environment agnostic**. It is able to run anywhere JavaScript can: cloud, edge, terminal, CI/CD, Node, Bun...
  even in the browser.
- **Trully Headless**. No frontend bias.
- **Modular & Embeddable**. Powered by a tiny, pluggable core.
- **Low-Code & Low-Config**. Spin up a full CMS in minutes.
